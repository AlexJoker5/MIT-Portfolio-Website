                    <p>Theology and Liberal Arts Programs are considered equally important for the churches and society
                         in Myanmar. Theology program produced thousands of competent church leaders, Pastors,
                         theological educators, and academic theologians while the liberal arts program produced
                         skillful professionals, organizational workers, and competent experts in different fields of
                         study interest.
                         Our Great vision is to promote the best theological and liberal arts education here in Myanmar,
                         and to upgrade the high level of MITâ€™s leading roles and its premiership in Myanmar and in
                         Asia.
